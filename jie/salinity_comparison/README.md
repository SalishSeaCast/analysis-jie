The IPython Notebooks in this directory are made by Jie for
quick sharing of results.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.ipython.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).
Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ##[CompleteMinLocValFre.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-jie/raw/tip/jie/salinity_comparison/CompleteMinLocValFre.ipynb)  
    
    * Compare minimum salinity value, location, fresh water amount between ferry observation, nowcast and new model results.  

* ##[FerrySalinityMixingRegion.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-jie/raw/tip/jie/salinity_comparison/FerrySalinityMixingRegion.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook was made to check the mixing region of jetty bathymetry with ferry data, to investigate if the modelled result makes sense.  

* ##[SalinityVVelocityPlotAtStations.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-jie/raw/tip/jie/salinity_comparison/SalinityVVelocityPlotAtStations.ipynb)  
    
    * This notebook was made to look at the salinity / U, V velocity vertical profiles with reduced viscosity, new bathymetry 6, nowcasts, no_banks at Sandheads, VENUS central/east/delta and station S4-3 during ebb and flood tide respectively.  

* ##[PlotThreeFerryRoutes.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-jie/raw/tip/jie/salinity_comparison/PlotThreeFerryRoutes.ipynb)  
    
    * This notebook was made to create three ferry routes shown in the map.   

* ##[FerryLineComparison_TimeInterp.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-jie/raw/tip/jie/salinity_comparison/FerryLineComparison_TimeInterp.ipynb)  
    
    * Based on 9 points ISW, as well as time interpolation for mdoel result to get one complete model result for data comparison.  

* ##[DetermineDiffusivity.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-jie/raw/tip/jie/salinity_comparison/DetermineDiffusivity.ipynb)  
    
    * By looking at location and value of minimum saliniy along TWDP route to determine the whether or not have lower diffusivity case.  

* ##[ThreeRouteSalinityTemplate.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-jie/raw/tip/jie/salinity_comparison/ThreeRouteSalinityTemplate.ipynb)  
    
    **Imports from research_ferries.py in my own directory**  

* ##[FerrySalinityForHindcast.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-jie/raw/tip/jie/salinity_comparison/FerrySalinityForHindcast.ipynb)  
    
    * This notebook was made to look at 1.5 m salinity comparison between reduced viscosity, no_banks, new bathymetry, nowcast model result and ferry salinity in the hindcast.  

* ##[CompleteMinLocValFre_TimeInterp.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-jie/raw/tip/jie/salinity_comparison/CompleteMinLocValFre_TimeInterp.ipynb)  
    
    * Similar with CompleteMinLocValFre.ipynb, except this notebook contains time interpolation, exclude the average of value and loc.  

* ##[SalinityCompareShlat.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-jie/raw/tip/jie/salinity_comparison/SalinityCompareShlat.ipynb)  
    
    * This notebook was made to compare ferry salinity with weakslip new river and weakslip jetty case.  

* ##[SaliCom_22dec15.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-jie/raw/tip/jie/salinity_comparison/SaliCom_22dec15.ipynb)  
    
    **Imports from figures.py**
