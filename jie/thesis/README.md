The IPython Notebooks in this directory are made by Jie for
quick sharing of results.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via

Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ##[CheckCoriolisFluxDailySeries.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-jie/raw/tip/jie/paper/CheckCoriolisFluxDailySeries.ipynb)  
    
    * Look at daily integral of freshwater transport with and withou Coriolis, and the averaged salinity in the English Bay.  

* ##[CoriolisSpatialPlot.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-jie/raw/tip/jie/paper/CoriolisSpatialPlot.ipynb)  
    
    * Plot the spatial salinity pattern at peak ebbs with and without Coriolis force.  

* ##[RmixRiverChannel.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-jie/raw/tip/jie/paper/RmixRiverChannel.ipynb)  
    
    * Tides impact in the river channel  

* ##[PlumePositionThesis.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-jie/raw/tip/jie/paper/PlumePositionThesis.ipynb)  
    
    * This notebook was made to look at the plume position defined by $x = \frac{\iint xf(x,y)dxdy}{\iint f(x,y)dxdy}$, $y = \frac{\iint yf(x,y)dxdy}{\iint f(x,y)dxdy}$, $f(x,y) = \int \frac{S_{0}-S}{S_{0}}dz$, affected by winds and the Coriolis force. $S_{0}$ = 30.  

* ##[FrNoPlot.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-jie/raw/tip/jie/paper/FrNoPlot.ipynb)  
    
    * Froude number plots at peak ebbs and floods.  

* ##[RmixPlumeLoc.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-jie/raw/tip/jie/paper/RmixPlumeLoc.ipynb)  
    
    * Rmix together with plume center location plot.
