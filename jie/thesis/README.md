The IPython Notebooks in this directory are made by Jie for
quick sharing of results.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.ipython.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).
Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ##[CheckCoriolisFluxDailySeries.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-jie/raw/tip/jie/thesis/CheckCoriolisFluxDailySeries.ipynb)  
    
    * Look at daily integral of freshwater transport with and withou Coriolis, and the averaged salinity in the English Bay.  

* ##[CoriolisSpatialPlot.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-jie/raw/tip/jie/thesis/CoriolisSpatialPlot.ipynb)  
    
    * Plot the spatial salinity pattern at peak ebbs with and without Coriolis force.  

* ##[FinalScatterOct-TestExcludeInnerLabels.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-jie/raw/tip/jie/thesis/FinalScatterOct-TestExcludeInnerLabels.ipynb)  
    
    * Remove inner label, change colormap for scatter plot.  

* ##[RmixRiverChannel.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-jie/raw/tip/jie/thesis/RmixRiverChannel.ipynb)  
    
    * Tides impact in the river channel  

* ##[PlumePositionThesis.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-jie/raw/tip/jie/thesis/PlumePositionThesis.ipynb)  
    
    * This notebook was made to look at the plume position defined by $x = \frac{\iint xf(x,y)dxdy}{\iint f(x,y)dxdy}$, $y = \frac{\iint yf(x,y)dxdy}{\iint f(x,y)dxdy}$, $f(x,y) = \int \frac{S_{0}-S}{S_{0}}dz$, affected by winds and the Coriolis force. $S_{0}$ = 30.  

* ##[FrNoPlot.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-jie/raw/tip/jie/thesis/FrNoPlot.ipynb)  
    
    * Froude number plots at peak ebbs and floods.  

* ##[RmixPlumeLoc.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-jie/raw/tip/jie/thesis/RmixPlumeLoc.ipynb)  
    
    * Rmix together with plume center location plot.
