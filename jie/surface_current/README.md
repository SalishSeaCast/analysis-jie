    * 1 Only river mean flow is closer to codar, that indicates winds effects much of the mean currents in the previous way.

* ##[HindcastSalCurrField.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-jie/raw/tip/jie/surface_current/HindcastSalCurrField.ipynb)  
    
    * This notebook was made to check the difference between short vs long river in the salinity and currents field in the hourly results. This work is motivated by the high value of min salinity in 3.6 with long river(TS4) vs TS2, which we speculate it may be either caused by intense vertical mixing or relatively low river flow at the mouth with long river (mass conservation). However, I don't quite believe that results and think if it is mainly caused by low river flow at the mouth, it seems to contradict with the baseline we have stronger currents field with long river even taken into account the tidal currents. What if that 3.6 daily results did not count in the tidal part as it resolves the tidal component. Here, in 3.4, with hourly results, I want to examine the same issue with short and long river and see if this makes diffrence.
