The IPython Notebooks in this directory are made by Jie for
quick sharing of results.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.ipython.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).
Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ##[FinalScatterOct.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-jie/raw/tip/jie/ios/FinalScatterOct.ipynb)  
    
    * Scatter plot for obs in October compared with extended river, reduced viscosity, reduced both viscosity and diffusivity cases for paper.  

* ##[IOS_fall2014Temp.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-jie/raw/tip/jie/ios/IOS_fall2014Temp.ipynb)  
    
    *  Look at data-new model temperature results comparison in fall, 2014.  

* ##[ScatterComparison.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-jie/raw/tip/jie/ios/ScatterComparison.ipynb)  
    
    Similarly, this notebook was to make scatter plot of S and T.  
      
    1) Compare with obs.  
      
    2) Compare with nowcasts.  

* ##[DiffusivityCTD.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-jie/raw/tip/jie/ios/DiffusivityCTD.ipynb)  
    
    * Scatter plot for obs in October compared with extended river, reduced viscosity, reduced both viscosity and diffusivity cases for paper.  

* ##[SummaryIOS.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-jie/raw/tip/jie/ios/SummaryIOS.ipynb)  
    
    * This notebook was made to look at:  
    1) Total CTD casts carried out by IOS.  
    2) How seasonally they are distributed?  
    3) The location?  

* ##[SummaryIOS_error.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-jie/raw/tip/jie/ios/SummaryIOS_error.ipynb)  
    
    * This notebook was made to look at:  
    1) Total CTD casts carried out by IOS.  
    2) How seasonally they are distributed?  
    3) The location?  

* ##[IOS_fall2014.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis-jie/raw/tip/jie/ios/IOS_fall2014.ipynb)  
    
    * Look at data-new model salinity results comparison in fall, 2014.
